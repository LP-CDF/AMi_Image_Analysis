# AMi Image Analysis: Automated Microscope Image Analysis

This is a Python 3 / PyQt5 project dedicated to the analysis of the images generated by the AMi microscope.
The AMi microscope is a low-cost automated microscope.

## Features:

I created this application to help the members of our laboratory in their crystallization work.
The software can read tiff or jpeg files.
Images are accessed via clicking on the corresponding well button or by navigating with keyboard shortcuts.
Images can be zoomed for thorough inspection and a Timeline of the cooresponding well is displayed if several pictures of the same well taken at different times are available.

Images are scored using the Drop Score section.
Notes can be taken and are saved to file.

A report of the current image can be saved as a pdf.

The results can be displayed on a grid and statistics are also calculated.

## Install

    The software was only tested on linux CentOS 7 with PyQt5 (v5.9.2 and v5.12.1) and python3 (v3.6.8 and v3.7.3).
    Hopefully, it should work on OSX and Windows.
    You will need a screen with minimum resolution of 1920*1080.

    Download the lastest released version and gunzip it.
    If on linux or OSX, link the correct Shortcuts_XXX version to Shortcuts.py
    If on Windows, copy the correct Shortcuts_XXX version to Shortcuts.py
